MECH 260-202: Midterm 2 (2022W2)
Questions
1. In the system below,
the rope stretches slightly under tension; the product of its Young's modulus E andcross-sectional area A is EA = 1MN;
the coefficient of friction between the rope and pulleys is very large, so the ropedoes not slip on the pulleys (if you prefer, you can imagine that the rope is pinned to the pulleys at the points of contact, which are labelled X and Y);
the shafts are rigidly connected to the wall at A and C, but the bearings at B andD are frictionless;
the length of the loaded portion of the rope (between the contact points) is Ltaut20cm as illustrated; and
a moment Mappi =50 N·m is applied to the pulley at D.

(a) (20 points) What are the reaction torques at A an代 写MECH 260-202: Midterm 2 (2022W2)C/C++

(b) (4 points) The rope will fail at a tension of 10kN. What is the overall factor ofsafety for the design (rope and shafts) under the given loading?
2. A long slender beam is subjected to a varying bending moment as illustrated below:

As illustrated in detail below, the beam's cross section has left-right symmetry but not top-bottom symmetry. The beam is made of steel, which has E = 200 GPa.

(a) (10 points) Find most tensile and most compressive bending stress experiencedanywhere in the beam.
(b) (2 points) Mark the location (s) where the most tensile and most compressive bending stress appears in the "Side View" section of the diagram above. Be sure to labelwhich is which.
